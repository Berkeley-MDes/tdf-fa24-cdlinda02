# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Week 1: Example Report 1 #
## Week of 09/02/2024

This is the second week of the Mdes program. This week, I mainly focused on getting familiarized with the resources that we're provided with, so I can utilize them later in the semester to help me with the projects. We toured Jacob's maker space and the fabrication lab at Wurster Hall during our orientation last week, which excited me. I attended the training for the robot arm and laser cutting so far, and I will attend the Form 3 3D printer the following Monday. 

I've used the laser cutter a lot in the past due to my background in architecture, and I believe my experience in Rhino prepared me well for the first project - Computational Design. However, I'm excited to explore more variety in the projects through this project and this class, to create more design beyond architectural models. Although I haven't started prototyping this week, I've been thinking about some ideas that I have for the phone holder. It seems to be a project at a much smaller scale than what I've been working on. I'm excited about this new challenge and see how my peers and I will approach it.

It's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions, make a copy.  Also, feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

Excited to work with you,
your TDF teaching team
