# Github Background Information & Context
If you’re new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that’s hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it’s super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I’m typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (💡 TIP: The .md indicates that we’re using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (💡 TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis 😄</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the “front page” of your GitHub repo. This is where we’ll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Week 1: Example Report 1 #
## Week of 09/02/2024
### Reflections
This is the second week of the MDes program. This week, I mainly focused on familiarizing myself with the resources we're provided with so I can utilize them later in the semester for projects. We toured Jacobs Maker Space and the fabrication lab at Wurster Hall during our orientation last week, which really excited me. So far, I’ve attended training for the robot arm and laser cutting, and I will attend the Form 3 3D printer training next Monday. Learning about the robot arm was particularly fun. I’m not sure if I’ll have the chance to use this technique with other projects this semester, but the idea of having a robot draw for me—possibly on a 3D surface—fascinates me.

### Speculations
I’ve used the laser cutter a lot in the past due to my background in architecture, and I believe my experience with Rhino has prepared me well for the first project—Computational Design. However, I’m excited to explore more variety in the first project and class, creating designs beyond architectural models. Although I haven’t started prototyping this week, I’ve been thinking about ideas for the phone holder. It seems to be on a much smaller scale than what I’ve worked on before, and I’m excited about this new challenge and exploring different approaches.
