# Week 3: Example Report 3 #
## Week of 09/16/2024
### Reflections
This week, I mainly worked on three different tasks for this class:
1. Modeling in Grasshopper
2. 3D printing
3. Project 1 video

**Part 1: Grasshopper** <br>
I gained more experience using Grasshopper and finished my project 1 design, which I'm really proud of. I started early and finished my design in Grasshopper over the weekend, so I will have enough time to experiment and get familiar with the 3D printers at Jacobs Makerspace. Throughout the process, I realized the design in my mind was actually more difficult to achieve in Grasshopper than I thought, which frustrated me. I searched online a lot to find the right components for me to use, and I also reached out to instructors for help. In the end, I was able to finish my design successfully.

**Part 2: 3D Printing** <br>
The 3D printing process was smoother than I expected, as my design was successfully printed on my first try. I asked Cody and other peers to figure out the correct settings for the printers, which was extremely helpful. However, it wasn't easy to find an available printer at Jacobs because everyone is printing their projects, so starting early next time is always nice. <be>

**Part 3: Video** <br>
After printing, sanding, and testing my design, I recorded a prototype demo video. I also spent time preparing the slides and recording my voice. It was challenging to compress everything into under 3 minutes, but I managed to do it through editing. You can find my video here(https://youtu.be/otJT29p8T_o) <br>

# Week 2: Example Report 2 #
## Week of 09/09/2024
### Reflections
This week, I explored Grasshopper for the first time. I was quite confused after our first Grasshopper demo in class, so I spent more time understanding the provided file over the weekend. I started by reading the notes and nodes, trying to create a high-level diagram that summarizes each cluster. Below is the first diagram I created in Figjam. I used different colors of sticky notes, and each color belongs to one big category, such as context, phone stand, cell phone, and testing. This approach is initially inspired by the concept maps we've been doing in the Design Framework class.

After Monday's class, I created another diagram, shown below. This diagram is inspired by inspecting the file from a high-level point of view and thinking what user needs are. I divided the diagram into three main parts: ingredients, process & tools, and goal. I think this diagram went beyond just simply interpreting each battery node in the file.

Moving on to the second part of the homework, I experimented with other geometric shapes in Grasshopper. 
I failed many times. I didn't know where to start at first. I kept getting a "bad assembly" warning.

*I explored other geometry using "center box" component but failed to align its origin with the phone*

**However, I was able to figure it out in the end through online tutorials, help from friends, and workshops from the instructor.**

*I followed Monday's workshop and created a rectangular form with a cylinder hole*

After adjusting the number sliders, I finally have a phone stand that works for my phone!

### Speculations
I think Grasshopper is a great tool as it allows me to change the parameters of geometry efficiently. In the provided file, I was also impressed by its ability to assess the center of gravity and other measurements, which I can see being applied in a variety of ways. Next week, I will try to explore more creative geometry forms within Grasshopper.

# Week 1: Example Report 1 #
## Week of 09/02/2024
### Reflections
This is the second week of the MDes program. This week, I mainly focused on familiarizing myself with the resources we're provided with so I can utilize them later in the semester for projects. We toured Jacobs Maker Space and the fabrication lab at Wurster Hall during our orientation last week, which really excited me. So far, I’ve attended training for the robot arm and laser cutting, and I will attend the Form 3 3D printer training next Monday. Learning about the robot arm was particularly fun. I’m not sure if I’ll have the chance to use this technique with other projects this semester, but the idea of having a robot draw for me—possibly on a 3D surface—fascinates me.

(Apologies for the large file size)

### Speculations
I’ve used the laser cutter a lot in the past due to my background in architecture, and I believe my experience with Rhino has prepared me well for the first project—Computational Design. However, I’m excited to explore more variety in the first project and class, creating designs beyond architectural models. Although I haven’t started prototyping this week, I’ve been thinking about ideas for the phone holder. It seems to be on a much smaller scale than what I’ve worked on before, and I’m excited about this new challenge and exploring different approaches.
